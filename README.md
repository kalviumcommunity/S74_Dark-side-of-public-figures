What is the MERN Stack?
The MERN stack is a popular full-stack JavaScript framework for building modern web applications.
It consists of four technologies:

MongoDB: A NoSQL database to store data in a JSON-like format.
Express.js: A server-side framework for handling HTTP requests and creating APIs.
React.js: A frontend library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
Node.js: A runtime environment to run JavaScript on the server.

And also we have learned about APIs

What is an API?
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines how requests are made, how data is exchanged, and what responses are expected.

Types of APIs
Web APIs (or HTTP APIs):

Used to allow interaction between client and server over the web (typically using HTTP).
RESTful APIs and GraphQL APIs are common examples.
Used for: Fetching data from a server, sending data to a server, etc.

RESTful API:

Structure: Organized around resources (like /users, /products, etc.).
Request Methods: Primarily uses GET, POST, PUT, DELETE for CRUD operations.

CRUD Operations in a REST API:

CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are the basic operations for interacting with data in a database or service. These operations are mapped to HTTP methods when designing a RESTful API.
